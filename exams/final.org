Practice final exam

1. Assume you have a data sequence in which you want to find K changes
   in mean. What kind of model parameters are there to infer, and how
   many of each parameter are there? Explain in detail the differences
   between binary segmentation and dynamic programming algorithms for
   computing model parameters.

2. Explain in detail the similarities and differences between Gaussian
   Mixture Models and Hidden Markov Models. What kinds of data are
   used as inputs? What parameters are there to infer? How many of
   each parameter? What hyper-parameters must be fixed before running
   the inference algorithms? How do the inference algorithms work?

3. Explain in detail the similarities and differences between the
   model selection procedures for segmentation/changepoint algorithms
   that we have seen in class (AIC/BIC/cross-validation/kink in the
   curve). Explain how each procedure could be used for model
   selection.

4. Describe the general dimensionality reduction problem. What are the
   inputs to a dimensionality reduction algorithm, and what are the
   outputs? What criteria can be used to evaluate the quality of a
   dimensionality reduction algorithm?

5. Explain in detail the similarities and differences between
   Principal Components Analysis and Autoencoders. What algorithms are
   used? How many parameters are there to infer? How to visualize the
   low-dimensional embedding of the data?

Rubric: 20 points for each question. Minus points for incomplete
and/or off-topic responses.

EXTRA CREDIT: 10 points for ALL students if ALL students have
completed the course eval by the end of the day Friday Nov 20.

For the real final exam on Friday Nov 20 at 7:30AM-9:30AM, what would be
the analogous questions for the other topics that we have studied?

Other questions that may appear on the final:

- Assuming there are some gold standard labels available, explain how
  the labels can be used to quantitatively evaluate a changepoint
  detection algorithm. What value(s) do you compute, and how do you
  interpret them?
- Describe the general segmentation / changepoint detection
  problem. What are the inputs to a changepoint algorithm, and what
  are the outputs?
