1. Describe the general clustering problem. What are the inputs to a
   clustering algorithm, and what are the outputs? 

2. Assuming there are some gold standard labels available, explain how
   the labels can be used to quantitatively evaluate a clustering
   algorithm. What value(s) do you compute, and how do you interpret
   them?

3. Explain the K-means algorithm in terms of the input/initialization,
   iterations, when to stop, and what values to output/return.

4. Explain the agglomerative hierarchical clustering algorithm in
   terms of the input/initialization, iterations, when to stop, and
   what values to output/return.

5. What is model selection? Explain how cross-validation can be used
   for clustering model selection.
