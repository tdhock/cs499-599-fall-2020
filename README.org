** Homeworks

To do the homeworks you need to install [[https://cloud.r-project.org/][the most recent version of R]]
(4.0.2) with either the [[https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/][RStudio]] IDE (for beginners) or the [[http://ess.r-project.org/][ESS]] IDE
(for students who already know/use emacs, or who want to learn, [[https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLwc48KSH3D1Onsed66FPLywMSIQmAhUYJ][my
emacs tutorials]]).

UPDATE Thurs Sept 10: [[https://docs.google.com/document/d/1W6-HdQLgHayOFXaQtscO5J5yf05G7E6KeXyiBJFcT7A/edit?usp=sharing][This General Usage Rubric]] will be used to grade the code
quality/style/efficiency in each of your homeworks.

General Questions and Answers
- can I do my homework with an older version of R? Maybe, try it if
  you want, but homeworks will typically require using R packages,
  which are only tested with the most recent versions of R, so if you
  are getting errors with an old version of R, try upgrading to the
  most recent version.

** How to ace this class

Before class you should prepare by doing the suggested
readings/videos. When you do that, write a summary in your own words
of every section. Also write questions that you have during your
reading so you can ask in class or office hours.

During class, take notes by writing what you understood in your own
words. Also I would suggest to ask questions in class as soon as you
need clarification.

After class, you should review your notes with one of your classmates
(ask one of the students who seem to be correctly answering a lot of
questions). Ask each other questions and try to teach/summarize some
of the material with each other -- that is one of the best ways to
learn.

Finally after doing all of the above, please come to office hours (see
syllabus), or email me to schedule a meeting.
