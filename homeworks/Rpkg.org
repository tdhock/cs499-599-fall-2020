R package coding project for CS599 graduate students ONLY

The goal of this project is to provide you with experience in
testing/documenting/distributing your code as a free/open-source R
package.

To figure out how to write an R package, you need to read the free
online book [[https://r-pkgs.org/][R packages]].

You need to select at least two functions that you coded in previous
coding projects to include in your R package. (e.g. KMEANS and HCLUST)

For each function you need to
- provide [[https://r-pkgs.org/man.html][documentation]] that includes example code that shows how to
  use it.
- write at least one [[https://r-pkgs.org/tests.html][test]] to make sure it returns a reasonable result
  (e.g. it returns an integer vector with same length as the number of
  rows of the input, and all values from 1 to the specified number of
  clusters).

You need to upload your code to a GitHub repository (you need a free
GitHub account so please create one if you don't have one yet). Your
repo should NOT include any files except source code/docs/tests/etc
required to build the package (e.g. you will get minus points if there
is a .Rhistory file in your github repo).

You need to setup [[https://r-pkgs.org/r-cmd-check.html#travis][automated checking after every commit with Travis]]
and make sure that your package passes checks with no WARNINGs and no
ERRORs (but NOTEs are OK).

You should write a README.md or README.org file that includes at least
two sections (1) Installation which explains how to install your
package via remotes::install_github("username/repo") and (2) Usage
which shows a few lines of R code about how to use your package (can
be same as examples).

Please upload a PDF with
- a link to your github repository,
  e.g. https://github.com/tdhock/LOPART
- a link to your most recent Travis build,
  e.g. https://travis-ci.org/github/tdhock/LOPART
- code/results from the R terminal from running examples for your
  functions. e.g. example("KMEANS", package="yourPkg") + results.

Extra credit (20 points): implement the dynamic programming algorithm
from [[file:9.org][homework 9]] in [[https://r-pkgs.org/src.html][C/C++ code]].
